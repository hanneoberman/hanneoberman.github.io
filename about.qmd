Currently, I\'m working as a lecturer and research associate at Utrecht University\'s [Methodology and Statistics department](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics).

For 50% of my appointment I get to teach and supervise students, mostly in topics related to [Applied Data Science](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/applied-data-science). The other 50% of my appointment is research time. I\'m involved in the [Missing Data](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/methodology-and-statistics/missing-data) group led by [Stef van Buuren](https://stefvanbuuren.name/) and [Gerko Vink](https://www.gerkovink.com/), and I assist projects guided by [Thomas Debray](https://thomasdebray.be/) at the [Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care](https://juliuscentrum.umcutrecht.nl/en/).
