I’m part of the Missing Data research group at Utrecht University, and software developer in the Amices team.\nYou can reach out to me if you have any questions about imputation with the R package {mice}, or if you want to collaborate on a project. I also offer workshops on missing data methodology, open science, and reproducible data science. And I’m available for consultation projects on imputing incomplete data, see our department website on statistical consulting or e-mail me (h.i.oberman at uu dot nl) directly.\nI aim to work open source and make all of my research repositories publicly available, for example on GitHub or the OSF. For an overview of my published work, see my ORCID page. Other places to find my research output are my CV, Utrecht University page, and Google Scholar."
